# Train-Station

Author: Deven Kumar

This is a project I wrote in my Intro to Object Oriented Programming II class. It contains code that represents a train station.

There are three files in the station folder. Station.java contains code for the Station class, and has functions that control the trains coming in and out of each station. Trian.java contains code for the Train class, and contains code for the people on each train. Person.java contains code for the person class, which represents a passenger on the train. Each person has a name, train number, and destination.
